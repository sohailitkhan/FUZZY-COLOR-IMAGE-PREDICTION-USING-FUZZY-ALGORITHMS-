Methodology,
Digital images are modified during the process of image enhancement to provide outcomes that are better suited for display or additional image analysis. To make it simpler to spot important details, you can eliminate the noise of the image, sharpen, or brighten an image. The key component of visual perception is color, which is also very crucial in many computer vision applications. Therefore, one of the most important tasks in computer vision and image processing is the accurate prediction of color in images.

Problem Statement,
The goal of this project is to create a model that can precisely forecast the colors of pixels in an image based on their surroundings. Because color perception is subjective and can vary depending on personal preferences and cultural backgrounds, fuzzy logic allows partial truths and uncertainty.

Fuzzy Algorithm
The basic idea of fuzzy logic is that truth can be expressed as a continual, in other words, an event can be partially true or partially false rather than absolutely true or false. Fuzzy sets (or areas) are the name given to these language expressions, allowing values of system variables to be described using language phrases like ‘high’, ‘low’, and ‘medium’.

Dataset
The dataset was taken from Kaggle, consisting of poorly defined and ambiguous objects. The actual color values of the objects in each image and the level of fuzziness needed to be annotated. The dataset was directed into training, validating, and testing data.

Loading of Dataset
The first thing done was to look for a dataset at Kaggle. The open() method in Python allowed for reading and writing the files. Python offers a variety of libraries and tools for working with datasets, including Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy.

Steps
Convert the image to gray level space
Calculate the weight of every pixel in the window
Calculate window’s means and variances in a weighted way
Sum up the images of every fuzzy window in a weighted way
Result
The image has been enhanced, with the RGB Color Space Image enhancement yet to be done.

Result Continued
The enhanced image shows the completion of RGB Color Space Image Enhancement.

Conclusion
A fuzzy color image prediction model was created that can correctly forecast the colors of individual pixels in a picture based on their surrounding environment, with high accuracy and stability.
